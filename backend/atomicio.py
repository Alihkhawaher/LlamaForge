"""Crash-safe file writes.

Every file LlamaForge owns (config.json, models.ini, vllm_models.json,
stats.json) is a small document rewritten in full. A plain truncating write
means a crash, a power loss, or a full disk mid-write leaves a half-file - and
for models.ini that loses every model the router knows about.

The pattern: write a sibling temp file, fsync it, then os.replace() onto the
target. os.replace is atomic on POSIX and on Windows (MoveFileEx with
REPLACE_EXISTING), so a reader ever sees the old file or the new one, never a
partial one.

The temp name carries pid+counter rather than a fixed `.tmp` suffix: two
LlamaForge instances (or a stray second dashboard) writing the same file would
otherwise collide on the scratch path and fail with a sharing violation on
Windows. That makes the write safe on its own, independent of any in-process
lock. Pure stdlib.

# os.replace is atomic on both platforms, but on Windows it is not *contention

# Defender or the search indexer opening the file we just wrote. POSIX rename
# has no such failure mode, so this retry is a no-op there.
